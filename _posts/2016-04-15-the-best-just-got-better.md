# **THE BEST JUST GOT BETTER**

London is now seen as the most desirable place in the world for wealthy overseas property investors. The city has replaced New York as World No.1 in the eighth annual Wealth Report published by global property consultants Knight Frank and is a financial, political and cultural powerhouse with rapidly expanding technology, media, telecommunications, business and retail service sectors.

The London property market recorded a strong 2014 and although things have become a little more subdued in the run up to May's General Election the overall trend is extremely positive. The Chancellor George Osborne's Autumn Statement also heralded a momentous change in the Stamp Duty system. Stamp duty costs will now be lower for all acquisitions below £937,500\.

In Kensington and Chelsea by contrast the average stamp duty charge is expected to rise by over £40,000 which may push investor demand to higher yielding, lower value parts of the city, although it is worth remembering that prices have risen by 17% since the last time Stamp Duty rates were raised for high-end property.

#### **CATALYSTS FOR CHANGE**

Across the city, expansion, job creation and regeneration are driving the market to new heights. Crossrail is delivering a new world class rail system that will connect the City, Canary Wharf, the West End and Heathrow Airport to commuter areas east and west of the capital, providing easier, quicker and more direct travel across London for the first time via new railway lines and tunnels.

It could help create £5.5 Billion in added value to residential and commercial real estate along its route between 2012 and 2021 as well as adding £20 Billion to the overall economy.

Crossrail will also support the delivery of over 57,000 new homes and 3.25 million square metres of commercial space with significant property investment taking place at locations all along the route.

London's labour market is expected to average a growth rate of 1.3% between 2015 and 2020 resulting in 67,000 net jobs per annum. Professional services and administrative & support services are expected to drive this growth.

The financial powerhouse that is Canary Wharf is expected to double it's working population by 2025, increasing demand for quality housing that is already greatly under-supplied.

Continued large scale investment is creating high growth areas such as Croydon, Lewisham and Stratford which are becoming increasingly attractive due to relatively affordable homes, great transport links and flourishing local economies.

#### **EAST MEETS EAST**

Since the transformation of Canary Wharf into one of Europe's most powerful business districts, London's centre of gravity has been moving east, a shift recently consolidated with the success of the 2012 Olympics.

In 2010, a vision document by the Mayor of London described the future of the Royal Docks. Identifying £22 Billion of development potential for a remarkable new district on the North Bank of the River Thames.

Royal Docks are well on their way to being restored as a commercial and trading centre fit for the 21st century with the £1 Billion deal to create the Asian Business Port forging new trade links with China and other economies in the Asia-Pacific region.

The 35 acre site will be development by ABP China and will see the creation of 2.5 million square feet of office space in total, 600,000 square feet of which is due to open in 2017\.

When complete Royal Docks will become London's third business district and, according to initial projections, be worth £6 Billion to the UK economy, create 20,000 full-time jobs locally, generate £23m in business rates annually and act as a catalyst for further development in the area.

Residential development schemes such as Hoola London are leading the way in meeting the veracious appetite for quality housing from Canary Wharf and The Asian Business Park.

#### **SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Supply and demand are key factors in any market. 2015 will see a formal announcement that Greater London's population is the biggest in its history, with City Hall set to proclaim that the previous high of 8,615,000 has been topped.

Forecasters say we're rapidly heading towards 9 million by 2020 and 10 million by 2035\. This is more than the equivalent of adding the population of the UK's second largest city, Birmingham, or three new London boroughs the size of Croydon, every ten years.

To put the increase in population into perspective, London's population has grown more over the last ten years than at any time in its 2,000 year history.

The mismatch between supply and demand has increased dramatically over the years. Annual new house-building has stayed around 20,000 to 25,000 over the last 30 years, however meeting the rising demand for accommodation requires a sustained increase in supply in both inner and outer parts of London at a minimum of 42,000 homes per annum.

With such strong demand and constricted supply London will continue to see solid growth for both capital values and rental returns.

#### **IN SUMMARY**

London will continue to be the number one property investment destination for many, due to the stable political landscape, strong economy and what has proved to be a recession proof housing market.

With the supply and demand gap ever increasing the question is quite simply "where" rather than "if" you should be investing in the London property.

Welcome to the greatest city on earth!
